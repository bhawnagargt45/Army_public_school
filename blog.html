                <p class="font-light w-3/4 pl-56">Independence Day is a festival of freedom for us. This was made possible by generations of freedom fighters; some known, many unknown. They made great sacrifices. Today, you and I breathe under free skies thanks to their heroic deeds.
                    I bowin respect to the pious memory of those brave martyrs. Our nation, like many others, suffered great injustices and tyranny under foreign rule. What distinguishes India, however, is that the character of our nationalist movement,
                    led by Mahatma Gandhi, was based on the principles of truth and non-violenceHe and all other national heroes provided us with an invaluable blueprint to not only liberate the nation from colonial rule, but also to rebuild it. Gandhiji's
                    struggle was for a return to Indian ethos and for human dignity. Now as we look back to the seventy five year journey of our republic, we have reasons to be proud of the considerable distance we have travelled. Gandhiji taught us that
                    slow and steady steps in the right direction are preferable to rapid strides in the wrong direction. The world looks up at the miracle of India, home to the plurality of traditions and yet the biggest and most vibrant democracy.</p>

                <p class="font-light w-3/4 pl-56">India's GDP will rise by USD 406 billion than the reference scenario by 2050 and more than 43 million jobs will be created, as the Asia's third-largest economy leaps towards a net-zero target, according to a report by Observer Research
                    Foundation (ORF). In the reference pathway, the Indian economy grows at a long-term compound annual growth rate of around five percent between 2020 to 2050, reaching approximately US$15 trillion (in 2018 dollars), the report states.
                    At the 2021 Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined a net-zero emissions target by 2070 for India. Also, India is targeting to increase its low-carbon power capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW)
                    by 2030, and meet 50 per cent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030. "India's net-zero carbon emissions target of 2070 is momentous and praiseworthy, but highly ambitious to say the least," an ORF statement said.
                    Structural changes and accelerants required to steer this transformation while balancing the twin goals of sustainability and development are detailed in the report 'Shaping Our Green Future: Pathways and Policies for a Net-Zero Transformation'.
                    The report, ORF said, is a compendium of essays that offers possible solutions to several pressing questions and aims to provide a roadmap for India's transition to a decarbonised and green economy.

                <p class="font-bold text-2xl">Some more Theories </p>
                <p>By the year 2050 India’s brain drain problem will completely stop, students from prominent institutes like IIT will no longer go outside India to find jobs. By that time Indian entrepreneurs, VCs will become more intelligent, risk takers
                    and will invest their money and time in more innovative companies rather than eCommerce and ride sharing. India will have world class Roads. Indian roads will be quite durable because by that time 90 % of the Indian roads will be made
                    with plastic. These plastic roads will reduce India plastic problems and India will look more clean and green. India will have more electric car than diesel and petrol car. Indian government has started producing ethanol and by the
                    year 2050, 90% of the vehicle will either run on ethanol or battery. Thus reducing India dependence on oil. Finally India will import less oil from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Self driving cars will be a normal thing. Self driving
                    technology will have been matured by that time and many Indian companies will adopt this new technology. Special corridors will be made for self driving cars which will have zero road accident record. India will have a separate highway
                    corridor for self driving trucks that will run at the speed of more than 200 km/h. These self driving trucks will be autonomous and mostly run on solar power and battery. India will have the largest number of Internet users after China.
                    By that time India will have highest Internet speed in the world. Thanks to JIO Fiber. JIO will be the single largest Internet service provider in India replacing Airtel. Vodafone and Idea will shut down their business. India’s tourism
                    industry will be larger than the economy of neighboring countries like Sri lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal combined. More and more people will visit India than ever before due to development in infrastructure, safety, cleanliness
                    and culture. India will have more engineers than the 1/3 of the world combined. Indian engineers will no longer be fascinated to work in Microsoft or Google but they will finally create something new themselves. By 2050 India will
                    have it’s own Trillion dollar company. This company will be a product company. Indians will be finally able to create product companies due to increase in wealth and influence around the world. People will get something new called
                    free basics by the government. Free basics will include house, food, health and education. By the year 2050 house, food, health, education will become free. Every individual will get free laptop, smartphone and other electronic gadgets
                    because demand for electronic gadgets will go down so price will become zero. Companies will give electronic gadgets for free and will make money from advertisement and sponsored apps. Most of the free electronic gadgets will be shipped
                    by China all over the world. But finally India will give tough competition to these Chinese tech giants due to huge labor power and abundance of good engineers in the country. Public transport will become more advanced and complex.
                    Many car companies will shut down their business. Only some will survive. India population will increase till 2030 and will seize by year 2050 due to public awareness and increase in literacy rate. India will touch 90 to 99 percent
                    literacy rate by that time. Most of the Universities will shut down their business because education will become free and degree won’t matter by that time. By year 2050 India will be involved in commercial farming and most of these
                    things will be done by Robot farmers which will drastically reduce food price and will make it negligible or you can say free. People availing free basics will be the new poor people of India. India will be very powerful country than
                    all of it’s neighbor and their neighbor combined except China. India’s 100 smart cities plan will be a real thing. By year 2030 India will spend huge money on Smart Cities. Rich people from congested, polluted and crowded cities will
                    move to these smart cities. Pakistan will finally stop sending terrorists to India due to it’s high-tech borders guarded by Ariel robot snipers, who will conduct surgical strikes almost everyday. Pakistan will remain a weaker country
                    due to it’s religion obsession over science and technology which will never let Pakistan grow. Pakistan will face next 30 years of Civil war due to it’s army taking over country and interfering in internal matters of the government
                    and public opinion. Pakistan army will try to overtake Pakistan civil government to establish an army rule in Pakistan. India will have a stable government because of democracy and citizens awareness and increase in literacy rate.
                    People will no longer fight for religion, caste and reservation in India. India will have almost 500 Billionaires with few trillionaires. Most of the jobs in the country will be taken over by Robots and more than 1/3rd of the population
                    will be jobless with nothing to do but will survive due to free basics given by government. Only smart jobs will be done by smart humans. Drone Corridor will be a real thing where drones will replace commercial flights and transport
                    people faster than today without colliding with each other. Drone ports will be fully automated. By Year 2050 India will also have world’s second largest army with fully automated drone fighters and drone snipers. People will live
                    in peace and harmony also life span of people will increase due to clean air and cheap treatment of almost all the diseases. India will have most number of high rise buildings in the world after China, USA India water interlinking
                    project will be completed by that time and areas of Assam, Bihar, Bengal will no longer face frequent floods. BJP will be the single largest party in the country and congress will be replaced by some new emerging party. Finally by
                    year 2050 Indian export will be larger than imports and India will no longer face the problem of trade deficit. Ecommerce goods will be delivered in 5 mins due to special goods delivery pipeline. Some of the animals will go extinct
                    and natural disasters like tornado, Thunder Storm,Drought will be frequent. Cutting trees, killing animals will put people in Jail. Hindi will be the new English for Indians.</p>
